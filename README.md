2015 DataPalooza Judging Criteria

Use of Open Data
* Does it incorporate open data in meaningful way?
	The entire application is powered by open data provided by The Sunlight Foundation and Google in partnership with the Voting Information Project
* How did open data shape the design of the project?
	Civic information is one of the few open data sets that every citizen in the U.S. deals with, and that has consistent data available for the entire nation

Impact
* What is the potential benefit of the project?
	A more informed voting public and increased voting by young people because it will be easier to be an informed voter
* What is the value proposition to customers?
	Time saving and clear information
* Is the project scalable?
	Yes. Unlike many data sets, information on representatives is readily available for all 50-states and some territories of the U.S. It is being developed using
	a platform that allows the scale of the application to grow as more people across the country start to use it.

Business Plan
* What is the problem?
	It is hard to find clear information on a person's representatives
* What is the solution?
	A single-page dashboard that just gives information relevant to the user.
* Are there competing solutions? If so, what makes this solution better?
	Yes, but they all act like a data-dump putting all the information about every representative on one page. There is currently no easy way to get varying levels
	of detail on just the representatives a person can do something about. For example, it is pointless for a person living in Raleigh, NC to get information about
	representatives from Alaska.
* Who are their key partners?
	They all only get data form one source, such as the Congress API from the Sunlight Foundation. This project will combine data from a few different sources to
	allow for comprehensive, consistent coverage over many levels of government.
* Is there a customer acquisition / rollout strategy?
	With the upcoming elections we will try and partner with local newspapers to get them to link to our site. There will also be apps for webbrowsers to allow users
	to quickly search selected text on Voterrific (for example the arbitrary name of a bill)
* Did the team identify customers (demographic, location etc)?
	All voting age people of the U.S. Targeted towards people from the age of 18-50 who are more likely to use computers and willing to try new, easier ways to become
	informed voters.
* What is the cost and revenue breakdown?
	The only costs are hosting and possibly some advertising. THe revenue will come from a small number of ads seamlessly included in the application and from donations
	(The Sunlight Foundation is funded by donations so this is likely a viable option for some revenue). This, like most open-data projects, will likely be non-profit.

Progress/Execution
* What resources will be required for success?
	Development of a working mobile-first web application before the 2016 election really kicks off. During the election will be the largest user-acquisition time period.
* What are key benchmarks in the project?
	(1) A working framework that loads a users location then shows their representatives
	(2) Expanding on this to include different features, such as searching for bills, committees, and other information. Each addition is a benchmark
		- Technical aspect: This will require nested menus
	(3) Allowing users to 'star' representatives, committees, and bills to add the to their home screen.
	(4) Summary categories to allow users to quickly get a summary of big information. Allow the users to drill down into the details of these large topics if they choose
	(5) Allowing users to input their opinion on different topics
* What steps will have to be taken and when?
	Developing the benchmarks listed above. Have as many completed and tested as possible before 2016.
* What will they demo at the Datapalooza?
	A working prototype, hopefully completing about 3 benchmarks listed above
